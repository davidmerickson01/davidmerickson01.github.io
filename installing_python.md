# Installing Python

* Go to <https://www.python.org>
* Click the "Downloads" menu item
* If you run Windows, click "Download Python 3.9.7". If you run Mac or Chromebook, 
* After it downloads, run the ".exe" file, usually by clicking on the download button at the bottom of the browser

*IMPORTANT: click the "Add Python 3.9 to PATH" checkbox! You need this to run python from a command prompt (which I will teach you about.)*

* Then click "Install Now" (If you forget to do this, just install again.)
* Windows "User Account Control" will ask you, "Do yuo want to allow this app to make changes to your device?" Click Yes.
* When you see "Setup was successful", then click "Close"
* Click the Windows button in the lower left and type "IDLE (Python 3.9...)".
* It will launch a program called "IDLE Shell" which prints text like this:

        Python 3.9.7 (tags/v3.9.7:1016ef3, Aug 30 2021, 20:19:38) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
        \>\>\> 

* Now you are ready to program in Python!
