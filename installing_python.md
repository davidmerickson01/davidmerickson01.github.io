# Installing Python

* Go to <https://www.python.org>
* Click the "Downloads" menu item
* If you run Windows, click "Download Python 3.10.0" or whatever the latest version is.
    * If you run Mac, there are instructions after "Looking for Python with a different OS?".
    * If you use Chromebook, Python should already be included. Press Ctrl+Alt+T for a terminal, then type "python3".
* After it downloads, run the ".exe" file, usually by clicking on the download button at the bottom of the browser

*IMPORTANT: click the "Add Python 3.10 to PATH" checkbox! You need this to run python from a command prompt (which I will teach you about.)*

* Then click "Install Now" (If you forget to do this, just install again.)
* Windows "User Account Control" will ask you, "Do yuo want to allow this app to make changes to your device?" Click Yes.
* When you see "Setup was successful", then click "Close"
* Click the Windows button in the lower left and type "IDLE (Python 3.10...)".
* It will launch a program called "IDLE Shell" which prints text like this:

        Python 3.10.0 (tags/v3.10.0:b494f59, Oct  4 2021, 19:00:18) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
