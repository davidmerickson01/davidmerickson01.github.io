# Learning Python

Installing python gives you two development tools:
* IDLE (Integrated Learning and Development Environment)
* Python executable

# Writing Python

To write python code, you need a text editor. You have several options:
* IDLE has an editor and debugger. This is where we'll start.
* notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac) are freely available
* VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/) - I use this at work
* You cannot use MS Word or Wordpad. They are not text editors.
