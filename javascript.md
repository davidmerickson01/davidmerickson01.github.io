# JavaScript programs

## Getting Started: Tools

* Text editor - I use <https://notepad-plus-plus.org>. For our club, plain old Windows Notepad is fine. Visual Studio Code is popular. Don't use WordPad or Word.
* Browser - We'll use the debug features of <https://www.google.com/chrome>. Any browser will work though. Press "ctrl-shift-i" to bring up "Developer Tools".
* Color Picker - <https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp> has a helpful one
* Online tutorials and references
    * <https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp>
    * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript>
* Our starting points
    * Google search "html getting started": Look for "Getting started with HTML - Learn web development | MDN"
    * Google search "w3schools javascript tutorial": Look for "JavaScript Tutorial - W3Schools"
    * Google search "javascript 2d canvas tutorial": Look for "Canvas tutorial - Web APIs | MDN"

## Getting Started: Writing your own program<
* Click on some page below. If you're just starting, pick one of the simple "Hello World" pages.
* Right click on page background (not the gray "canvas") and select "Save Asâ€¦". Then open the file in your text editor.
* Or, right click, "View page source", then copy-and-paste the HTML from the browser into a new file in your text editor.
* Once it's in your text editor, it's time to code! For now, just change some of the text you see on the screen, like "Hello World".
* Save the modified file.
* Using Windows Explorer, drag and drop the file to Chrome. You should see your modification. You can also right-click and choose "Open with.." and select Chrome.
