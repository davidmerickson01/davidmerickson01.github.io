# HTML programming

## Getting Started: Tools

* Text editor - I use <https://notepad-plus-plus.org>. For our club, plain old Windows Notepad is fine. Visual Studio Code is popular. Don't use WordPad or Word.
* Browser - We'll use the debug features of <https://www.google.com/chrome>. Any browser will work though. Press "ctrl-shift-i" to bring up "Developer Tools".
* Online tutorials and references
    * <https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp>
