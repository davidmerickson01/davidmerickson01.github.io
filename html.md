# HTML programming

## HTML Tutorial and References
* We're using <https://www.w3schools.com>
* Click on Tutorials, then "Learn HTML"
    * Pick a topic on the left, read about it, then do "Try it Yourself"
* Click on References, then "HTML Tag Reference"
    * Find a tag on the left, read about it, then do "Try it Yourself"

## Getting Started: Tools

* Online editor is <https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default>
* Text editor - I use <https://notepad-plus-plus.org>. For our club, plain old Windows Notepad is fine. Visual Studio Code is popular. Don't use WordPad or Word.
* Browser - We'll use the debug features of <https://www.google.com/chrome>. Any browser will work though.
    * Right click, "View Source" is helpful.
    * Ctrl-Shift-i to bring up "Developer Tools".

## Pages

In Chrome, click on the page, then right click, "View Source" and study the HTML.
